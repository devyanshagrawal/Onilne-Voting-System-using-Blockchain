# Onilne-Voting-System-using-Blockchain

Online voting is a trend that is gaining momentum in modern society. It has great potential to decrease organisational costs and increase voter turnout. It eliminates the need to print ballot papers or open polling stations—voters can vote from wherever there is an Internet connection. Electronic voting systems must be legitimate, accurate, safe, and convenient when used for elections. A single vulnerability can lead to large-scale manipulations of votes. Blockchain technology came into the ground to overcome these issues and offers decentralized nodes for electronic voting and is used to produce electronic voting systems mainly because of their end-to-end verification advantages. 

<h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
<li>Eligibility: Only legitimate voters should be able to take part in voting</li>
<li>Un-reusability: Each voter can vote only once</li>
<li>Privacy: No one except the voter can obtain information about the voter’s choice</li>
<li>Fairness: No one can obtain intermediate voting results</li>
<li>Soundness: Invalid ballots should be detected and not taken into account during tallying</li>
<li>Completeness: All valid ballots should be tallied correctly.</li>

<h2>SYSTEM MODEL</h2>

<h2>WORKING</h2>
Firstly a election needs to be started using a desired name.

After we submit, transaction needs to happen using geth.

After successful start of an election, now candidates need to be added by the authorized person.
